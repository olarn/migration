Database: MSSQL

Migration Source schema.tables (from folder source schema):
- [case-migration].dbo.stg_case_inprogress | as a master table
- [case-migration].dbo.stg_sla_per_owner
- [case-migration].dbo.stg_case_document_reference

Mogration Destination database schema.tables (from folder destination schema):
- [case-management].dbo.case_transaction | as a master table
- [case-management].dbo.case_transaction_comment | as a details of case_transaction 
- [case-management].dbo.case_transaction_document_reference | as a details of case_transaction 
- [case-management].dbo.case_transaction_sla_activity | as a details of case_transaction 
- [case-management].dbo.case_transaction_sla_hop | as a details of case_transaction 

Mapping (folder Mapping):
- code that implement with Java

Migration as-fast-as-posible Guideline:
1. Parallel Extract & Load - Use bulk operations and parallel processing
2. Set-based Validation - Minimize row-by-row operations
3. Efficient Key Mapping - Use hash joins and indexed lookups
4. Batch Entity Curation - Process in chunks to manage memory
5. Optimized Bulk Loading - Use minimal logging and table locks
6. Smart Constraint/Index Management - Disable during load, rebuild after
7. Performance Metrics - Monitor and optimize bottlenecks
8. CDC Catch-up - Efficient change tracking
