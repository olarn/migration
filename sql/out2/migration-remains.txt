Items not implemented in SQL (still handled only in Java):

- Encryption: `product_number_full_1..3` encrypted in Java (`CreateCaseService.encryptField`) is not done in SQL
- SLA dates: `sla_start_date` and `sla_target_date` computed by `SlaService` (business hours/holidays) are not set in SQL
- Case-type transitions and ownership normalization:
  - FCR: force completed status, clear owner/team, set closed info
  - IN_PROGRESS/RESOLVED/END flows set `status_code`, `active_hop_number`, owner/team and status-change fields
  - These rely on meta-data and are not reproduced in SQL
- Lock flags: `is_stm_locked`, `is_hop_locked`, `is_owner_locked` not set in SQL
- OneApp-specific validations and adjustments (`processCaseTransactionForOneAPP`):
  - Payroll/PWA owner correction (manager fallback) and related team/owner updates
  - FinCer field validations
  - Master data enrichment (e.g., original problem channel value)
- Created/modified by IDs: user/team IDs on activities and document refs not populated by SQL (left NULL)
- Document reference IDs: Java uses DB-generated UUID; SQL uses deterministic UUID (MD5 of case|object|file) â€“ different strategy by design
- SLA calculation nuances: Java applies service-type matrix and hop logic; SQL only inserts raw hop/activity durations

Covered in SQL (aligned with Java):

- `visible_on_touch`, `fcr` normalization from string values
- Truncation to destination column lengths
- SLA default to 0.0 when source is non-numeric
- SLA activity action literal set to `CHANGE_OWNER`
- Document reference `file_name` sourced from `Name`
